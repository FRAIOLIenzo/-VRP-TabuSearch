# Tabu Heuristic for the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)

## Project Description

This project aims to solve the well-known Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using a tabu heuristic. The objective is to find an optimal or near-optimal route that allows a vehicle to travel through a set of cities (or customers) while minimizing the total distance traveled and respecting specific constraints. Here, each city must be visited only once before returning to the starting point, and the route must cover all cities.
