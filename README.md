# Tabu Heuristic for the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)

## Project Description

This project aims to solve a variant of the well-known Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) using a tabu heuristic. The objective is to find an optimal or near-optimal route that allows a vehicle to travel through a set of cities (or customers) while minimizing the total distance traveled and respecting specific constraints. Here, each city must be visited only once before returning to the starting point, and the route must cover all cities.
